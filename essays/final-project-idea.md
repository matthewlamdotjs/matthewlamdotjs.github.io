#Overview (including “The problem” and “The solution”)

Students taking a foreign language often don't have fluent speakers to practice with. The solution is an online social networking site that aims to connect international students that are fluent in a foreign language with those studying that foreign language at UH.

#Mockup page ideas

Signup page: form with public and private info as well as checkboxes for seeking help or offering help with a foreign language (you can be both)

Login page: login stuff

Home page: two tabs: "get help", and "give help". Search for students willing to help based on language out of users with a request button to request help. includes feed of most relevent and recent ads.

Contacts: people who have accepted your request where you can see the people you've worked with as well as rate them.


#Use case ideas

A student taking Japanese 201 needs help speaking conversational Japanese. An international student from Japan needs help with English and is willing to help with Japanese while making a friend along the way!

#Beyond the basics

Verification of student actually being an international student from registrar database. Verification that the student seeking help is actually taking the corresponding foreign language.
