## Javascript: A Comparison

Having a minimal experience with Javascript in the past using JQuery in a Rails application, I can already see how very useful Javascript can be within the scope of web development. In comparison with statically typed languages such as C, C++ and Java I have to say Javascript is much more versitile in certain ways. However, syntactically I believe Javascript still has many hangups when compared with Ruby or Python.

Now I am only speaking of the languages I personally use because that is all I have to go on so my perspective is going to be such. Yes Javascript has the most active community and possibly the greatest number of libraries- which is a selling point for a lot of people, but I still think it could be improved by means of removing semicolons, braces, etc. I still find it bulky compared to my favorite languages which could be partially due to the fact that I have become lazy over the years (the first language I learned was C++ and will probably never use again). All in all, I understand Javascript's value, but I'm not completely sold yet.

## Athletic software engineering

The practice of athletic software engineering is a great immersion technique. Much like learning a spoken language in a foreign country, I believe it can help you to "think in the language" in contrast to learning through translation.

A timed "workout of the day" in a language I'm not particularly familiar with, such as Javascript, poses its challenges as the stress of the clock along with trying to remember which syntax to use can cause me to waste time in panic. However I believe this is all a part of the fun and excitement of learning and I embrace the challenge.
