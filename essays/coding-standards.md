## Setup 

I'm going to be frank here. Setting up ESLint was not as straightforward as I had originally thought and the benefit is not clear to me yet as I haven't been using it for an extended period of time.

## Coding Standards for Learning

I think coding standards may in fact hinder fast paced learning. Yes you will produce clean consistent code that is easy to read which one may argue is the right way to learn. I personally prefer learning something quick and dirty. Making good readable code should come naturally through practice if one truly understands what they are writing.

## Conclusion

Coding standards, particularly using ESLint are a cool way to have the equivalent of Microsoft Word's spellcheck. Through my limited experience using the tool, I have not felt the importance of it yet as others may have.
