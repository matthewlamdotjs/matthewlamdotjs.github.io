## Back-end Perspective

I've never liked front-end development. This is partially because I've never been particularly good at it and I often consider it more of work for an artist with technical knowledge. As someone who feels they are more suited for back-end development, the availability of various UI Frameworks is enticing and quite a relief when tackling an entire project solo.

## First Impressions

When I first started learning Semantic UI via Pluralsight's exhaustive course, it was a lot of information to take in. The examples given made Semantic UI seem incredibly easy and reminded me of a similar course I had taken on Twitter Bootstrap. Both great resources, they share similar ideas (although Pluralsight's videos often try to call out Bootstrap on its differences) and both are fairly easy to get started. However I often found that implementing the examples from the Semantic videos didn't always work in existing projects. Likely due to a conflict with existing styling in my projects, I found that using Semantic required a deep understanding of how Semantic UI works.

## Cost-benefits

Considering the amount of effort it takes to truly wrap your head around Semantic and use it to its full potential, I sometimes question its value to the average end-user. For example, the sometimes confusing styling of grids and containers often makes me ask myself why I don't just use an html table element instead with width set to 100% for the same responsive layout. Some features are convenient and easy to use for a beginner and I can see how investing time into mastering Semantic UI or any other UI framework can be extremely beneficial to someone dedicated to front-end development.

## Personal Journey

I don't see myself ever trying to use Semantic to its full potential. However I will continue to use it in small areas where its easier for me to implement given my current understanding of how Semantic works. Maybe I will give Bootstrap another try instead?
