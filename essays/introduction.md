## A Search From Within

In my first two years of college, I majored in business. This was in part due to an influence from my family and their beleif that studying business would make me very wealthy one day. I figured that I liked business since I didn't dislike it and classes were relatively straight forward (not a lot of abstract thinking). I was content with this path until I found something in academia that truly excited me in contrast to an excitement I would get from being above average at a certain subject.

The course was titled "Secret Writing" and it satisfied a core requirement at the small liberal arts school I first attended. During the class we studied cryptography, ciphers, and the impact and significance of these in the modern world. A few of our excercises involved fiddling with the command line and practicing public key encryption which gave me my first taste of the world of computer science, thus encouraging me to switch my major to a field I had hardly any knowledge of yet was fascinated by.

## Software Development vs. Computer Science

There is no question that my pursuit of a B.S. degree in Computer Science stemmed from an interest in Computer Science itself, having been romanced by the idea of pushing the bounds of algorithm efficiency and its application to cryptography. However as I went further into study, my interest shifted as I found that I had an unwavering motivation when it came to completing programming assignments in classes that focused on software development skills, much more so than those that focused on theory of computation. Although computer science itself fascinated me still, its engineering aspect is what gave me the most satisfaction.

## Learning Practical Skills

My goals in the world of information technology have become more defined, and as a result I have found a certain set of software development skills most desirable. Most of these have to do with web development. I've worked on large web applications as a contributor and I feel very comfortable adding and modifying code. However I would like to really become more comfortable at starting a large software project from scratch. Planning and organization during the early stages of a software project as well as becoming more comfortable with setting up large projects and knowing all the components needed are most definitely things I hope to gain in my studies in and out of the classroom.

## Defining Success

As I approach the end of my college education, I will find myself measuring my success not only in the skills I have acquired in software development but more importantly my whether or not I have the ability to jump into new and unfamiliar software projects, languages and frameworks and become proficient quickly.
