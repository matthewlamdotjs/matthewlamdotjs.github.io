## A Search From Within

In my first two years of college, I majored in business. This was in part due to an influence from my family and their desire to place me in such a way that I would become very rich one day. I figured that I liked business since I didn't dislike it and classes were relatively straight forward (not a lot of abstract thinking). I was content with this path until I found something in academia that truly excited me in contrast to an excitement I would get from being above average at a certain subject.

The class was titled "Secret Writing" and it satisfied a core requirement. During the last we studied cryptography, ciphers, and the impact and significance of these in the modern world. A few of our excercises involved fiddling with the command line and practicing public key encryption which gave me my first taste of the world of computer science.
