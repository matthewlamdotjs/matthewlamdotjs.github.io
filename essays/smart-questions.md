## Prequisites 

Having read "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way" by Eric Steven Raymond, his guidelines for asking a smart question appear to revolve around doing your research. This means exploring every possible avenue available before asking an expert. Raymond implies that a show of respect goes a long way in asking a question and is a prerequisite to asking a smart question.


## Sorted and Unsorted Arrays

If you search all questions in StackOverflow and sort by votes, you will find in the following question at number one: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-it-faster-to-process-a-sorted-array-than-an-unsorted-array">Why is it faster to process a sorted array than an unsorted array?</a>. It is a question that you won't find the answer to in C++ documentation and requires a deeper understanding of processor architechture (this is the start to forming a smart question). Additionally, the user asking this question shows their work, showing that they have tried to execute his code in multiple ways, states what he knows and what he does not know. As a result of his effort, his question is met with a multitude of great answers from enthusiastic individuals. This is an example of a smart question and its reward.

## How to Send 100,000 emails weekly

At <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3905734/how-to-send-100-000-emails-weekly">How to send 100,000 emails weekly?</a>, you will find a very bad question asking how to send 100,000 emails a week using PHP. There are no references to research or problems encountered in attempts to solve the problem. It seems that this user is asking for someone else to do his work and give a code snippet that can be simply copied and pasted. Furthermore, the question was off topic for the forum it was posted in. 

## Findings

Now that we have explored a good and bad example of a smart question, we can discuss why smart questions are important for smart software engineers. It is safe to assume that a smart software engineer will have these goals in mind: solving problems efficiently and being able to explain things clearly. Solving problems efficiently can be aided by an ability to ask smart questions because a smart question is more likely to get a smart and often quicker response. The skills involved in forming a smart question are the same skills one would use to explain an idea clearly, something invaluable when doing collaborative work.
